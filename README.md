# Introduction to Cryptography
Python activities to understand cryptography concepts.

---

This repository contains ciphers algorithms, such as:

**Classical**

The classical algorithms are those invented pre-computer up until around the 1950's. The list below is roughly ordered by complexity, least complex at the top.
1. Atbash Cipher
2. ROT13 Cipher
3. Caesar Cipher
4. Affine Cipher
